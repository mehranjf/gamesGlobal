how to run in locally
=========================
pull from project + 
npm i +
npm run dev

============================
for better performance I tried to implement reusable component and some custom hooks such as usedebounce(for putting delay in search) and useDetectClickOutsideComponent for detecting click outside of component which i use in filter part.
beside that i try to break component to small component that they are responsible for one task.
